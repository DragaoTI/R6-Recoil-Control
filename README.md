## File Structure

Ensure that the `Agents` and `presets` folders are in the same directory as the main script `main.py`.

```
Recoil-Control/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recoil_controller.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.cfg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attackers/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presets/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <agent_name>/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## How to Start the Application

To launch the application, run `main.py` or use the compiled executable [R6-Recoil-Control.exe](https://github.com/K1ngPT-X/R6-Recoil-Control/releases/download/v1.0.2/R6-Recoil-Control.exe):

```bash
python main.py
```

## Core Features

### Recoil Control

*   **Enable/Disable Recoil**: The main button on the interface (`Disabled`/`Enabled`) toggles recoil control.
    *   **Red**: Recoil disabled.
    *   **Green**: Recoil enabled.
    *   Button and hover colors change dynamically.
*   **Adjust Recoil Values**:
    *   Use the **sliders** to visually adjust vertical (Y) and horizontal (X) recoil values for both primary and secondary weapons.
    *   You can also **click and type** values directly into the input fields next to the sliders for greater precision. Press `Enter` after typing to apply the change.
*   **Active Weapon**: The application automatically switches between primary and secondary weapon recoil control based on configured hotkeys.

### Settings

Click the "Settings" button to open the settings window:

*   **Hotkeys**:
    *   **Primary Weapon Hotkey 1 & 2**: Set the keys or mouse buttons to switch to the primary weapon. Click "Record" and press the desired key/button.
    *   **Secondary Weapon Hotkey 1 & 2**: Set the keys or mouse buttons to switch to the secondary weapon. Click "Record" and press the desired key/button.
*   **Secondary Weapon Enabled**: Check or uncheck this box to enable or disable recoil control for the secondary weapon.
*   **Shoot Delay**: Adjusts the delay between recoil corrections.
*   **Sensitivity**: Adjusts the overall sensitivity of recoil control.
*   **Max Movement**: Defines the maximum allowed movement for recoil correction.

Settings are automatically saved to the `settings.cfg` file whenever you make a change.

### Preset Management

Click the "Presets" button to open the preset management window:

1.  **Agent Selection**: Choose between "Attackers" or "Defenders" to view the list of agents. Click an agent's icon to manage their presets.
2.  **Manage Presets for Selected Agent**:
    *   **Save Preset**: Enter a name in the "Preset Name" field and click "Save Preset" to save the current recoil settings (X and Y for both weapons, and if secondary weapon is enabled) as a new preset for the selected agent.
    *   **Load Preset**: Select an existing preset from the "Load Existing Preset" dropdown and click "Load Preset" to apply these settings. A confirmation will be requested.
    *   **Delete Preset**: Select an existing preset from the dropdown and click "Delete Preset" to remove it. A confirmation will be requested.

## üîç Executable (.exe) Safety Verification

This project includes an executable (`.exe`) built using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/), a widely-used packaging tool for Python projects. Although legitimate, executables created with PyInstaller may occasionally trigger **false positives** in less well-known antivirus software.

To ensure transparency, we conducted a full scan using [VirusTotal]((https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/16fbbdf06d640cf6bf08d2d46fa075b433b43643c209b9d7835506c15ae82893/detection). Here are the results:
